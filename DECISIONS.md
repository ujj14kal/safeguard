# DECISIONS.md — deviations from the brief

Log of every deviation from the project brief, with reasons. Newest first.

## Phase 0

1. **Clone location**: the brief says to `git clone` the repo "into this folder".
   The working folder is the macOS home directory, so cloning the repo contents
   into it directly would mix the repo with the whole home folder. Instead the
   repo was cloned as `./safeguard/` (standard `gh repo clone` layout) and all
   project work happens there.
2. **Hook PII placeholders**: the pre-commit hook blocks staged secrets, tokens,
   `.env` files, and phone numbers. Apple Team ID and personal email are
   configurable at the top of the hook (`BLOCKED_TEAM_ID`, `BLOCKED_EMAIL`) and
   intentionally left empty in the committed copy — real values go only in the
   local, untracked `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, since the repo is public.
3. **Fictional-number allowance**: the hook permits the fictional `+1-555-01xx`
   range so fake contacts/test numbers can appear in code, tests, and docs.
   All other E.164-looking numbers are blocked.
